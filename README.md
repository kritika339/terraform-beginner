This a working example (with instructions) on how to create a beginner Terraform lab.
Terraform is a tool offered by Hashicorp to facilitate Infrastructure-as-a-Code service.
This repo has step-by-step instruction to short-lived launch a AWS sandbox.
In that sandbox, an EC2 instance will be pre-baked in with Terraform installed on it.
Once you are into the EC2 instance, create main.tf file to launch another t2.micro instance.

After completing the Beginner use case, try out another fun way to learn Intermediate use case using Terraform.
In the Intermediate use case, using same AWS Sandbox, create an S3 bucket and a Lambda function to create a serverless pattern.
